# (Tropa) Face Detection using YOLOv3 Deep Learning Framework
This is a short implementation of the YOLOv3 Framework to train a model to detect and localize the faces of me and 4 of my friends (DJ, Gab, Nicolo, Nuy) using Pytorch backend and Roboflow for image labelling and annotation. The YOLOv3 framework is a Deep Learning framework originally developed for fast object localization tasks (with hundreds to thousands of active classes). For more information about YOLOV3, check out this [great blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/review-yolov3-you-only-look-once-object-detection-eab75d7a1ba6).

LOGS
* Model trained using 25 images from each friend class under 50 epochs.
* Average model performance as expected
* Local machine (laptop) does not have sufficient computing power and memory to perform larger scale training

ASSESSMENT
* Algorithm and preprocessing steps works and can be improved with more resources
